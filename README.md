Contributions:

Challenges: 
* I couldn't figure out why my routes weren't working then realized I had to move the GET request with the asterisk to the bottom of the screen. 

* Seperation of concerns and file path- remembering to export and require when needed. 

* Learning how to use mySQL workbench was challenging, but in the end, just another tool in my belt. 

Successes: 
The app is functional! 

Roadmap: Creating this app was a good introduction to databases.
