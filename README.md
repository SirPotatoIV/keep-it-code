Live site: https://keep-it-code.herokuapp.com/

Description: Full stack project to create a blog/news site where web development boot camp students voice opinions and advice.

Usage: The usage of this application is for 1. the general public to read about the day in the life of a new web developer (i.e struggles, successes, pearls of wisdom, etc...).

2. authorized users can log on and write/submit articles

Images: Starting layout concept (wireframes)

Finished view:

Mobile View:

Installation and main Tech:

1. for the general public:

2. for users:

CDNs used: Axios https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js

Platforms used:

- Heroku: cloud based server for our application

- Firebase: used for user authentication and verification

- Node.js: used for scalability, modularization, vast NPM and third party libraries, etc...

Frameworks used:

- Express: third party library and main server framework for node.js

Databases: mySQL Workbench, JawsDB.

ORM: Sequelize, promise based and works well with mySQL

Linters used:

- Husky: manage git hooks

- ESLint: manage problematic code in JavaScript

Contributions: For our group project, we had a team of four members: Jake O'Toole - Project Manager & Lead Developer, AyDy Burling - Web Developer, Claudio Garcia - Lead Designer, Mark Sirany - Web Designer.

Challenges: (elaborate as you please)

1. Server and database integration
2. deployment
3. img conversion, compression and storage in database - non conventional
4. connection, routes, ports, oh my
5. smack the server to get what and post how?
   -postman to the rescue
6. time
   - where's the Eye of Agamotto when you need it?
   - five most dangerous words in the beginning dev stage "Wouldn't it be cool if...?"
7. authentication and new tech
   - let me learn Firebase real quick

Successes: Great group dynamic. Effective communication between front-end and back-end. Working application (hopefully).
TO BE CONTINUED...

Road Ahead:

1. servers (jake- i'll need help elaborating on this about the images/CDN)
2. database - better setup (foreign keys, joins)
3. ability for subscribers to donate money
